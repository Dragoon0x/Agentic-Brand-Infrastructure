# DYOR: Do Your Own Research

**Before using, implementing, referencing, or building upon anything in this repository, please read this carefully.**

## This Is Experimental

Everything in this repository exists at the frontier of where AI, branding, and product design are heading. It is speculative. It is exploratory. It is a starting point, not a finished product.

Do not treat any of this as production-ready without your own thorough evaluation.

## Before Taking Any Action

1. **Evaluate independently.** Test every schema, template, framework, and piece of code in your own environment before deploying anything.

2. **Consult professionals.** If you are making business, legal, financial, or strategic decisions informed by this project, get professional advice first. This project is not a substitute for qualified counsel.

3. **Understand the risks.** AI agent systems, brand automation, and negotiation protocols are emerging areas. Standards do not exist yet. Regulations are evolving. What works today may not work tomorrow.

4. **Test in isolation.** Never deploy experimental code or frameworks directly into production systems without sandboxed testing first.

5. **Verify compliance.** Laws around AI, data privacy, automated decision-making, and consumer protection vary by jurisdiction. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in your region.

6. **Assess fitness.** Not every concept in this repo will be relevant or appropriate for your specific industry, brand, product, or market. Evaluate fitness for your context before adopting anything.

## What This Project Is

- A collection of experimental frameworks and ideas
- A starting point for exploration and discussion
- An educational resource for thinking about agentic brand infrastructure
- Open source code and schemas you can learn from and build upon

## What This Project Is NOT

- Professional advice of any kind
- A production-ready system
- A guaranteed methodology for business success
- A legal framework for AI agent deployment
- A substitute for your own judgment, research, and professional counsel

## The Author's Intent

This project was created to push thinking forward in an emerging space. The author (Dragoon) shares this work openly in the spirit of advancing the field. The author is not responsible for how you use, interpret, or implement any of it.

## Bottom Line

**Do your own research. Test everything. Get professional advice when it matters. Use your own judgment. Proceed at your own risk.**
